"""stopwatch is a very simple Python module for measuring time.
Great for finding out how long code takes to execute.

>>> import stopwatch
>>> t = stopwatch.Timer()
>>> t.elapsed
3.8274309635162354
>>> print t
15.9507198334 sec
>>> t.stop()
30.153270959854126
>>> print t
30.1532709599 sec

Decorator exists for printing out execution times:
>>> from stopwatch import clockit
>>> @clockit
    def mult(a, b):
        return a * b
>>> print mult(2, 6)
mult in 1.38282775879e-05 sec
6
